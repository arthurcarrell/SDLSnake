# Snake with SDL

I think this is done for now. 
A working game of snake for SDL made entirely by me. Don't judge, this is one of the first experiences ive had with SDL and one of my first projects in C++. *although this could of probably been done in C just as easy...*

Not sure anyone will pay attention to this, but if you do, feel free to do whatever you want with this.

Not going to say im proud of this, there are a lot of unnnessasary functions and its not very object-oriented. But I think it served as a very good lesson on how to do stuff and what *not* to do.

Overall, pretty bad project, but the snake was the knowledge I gained along the way.
