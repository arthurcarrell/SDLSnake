# Snake with SDL

Its going to be snake with SDL.
Currently got the Cell system working, along with the rendering to go along with it.
Now all I need to do is actually code snake :P

Currently, the code is messy, unorganised, and contains a lot of bloat (not counting comments as bloat btw)
What im going to do:
- Code the snake logic
- Code the scoring system
- Clean up and remove uneeded code
